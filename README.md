Examples
========
```
"Hello world" print
```


# run main.plast file
```
$ make
```

# run tests
```
$ make test
```

#STEP 1
make fine PLAST 1.0 > C code translator, writen on JAVASCRIPT

#STEP 2
make PLAST 2.0 > C code translator, writen on PLAST 1.0

#STEP 3
rewrite PLAST 2.0 > C code translator to PLAST 2.0

#STEP 4
ADD a lot of native types, Garbage Collector and etc
